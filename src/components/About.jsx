        I'm a skilled software developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science Engineering. My expertise includes web development, backend systems, and database management. I've built robust applications using <span className='text-custom-text-3'>React.js</span> for dynamic front-ends, <span className='text-custom-text-3'>Node.js</span> for scalable backends, <span className='text-custom-text-3'>PostgreSQL</span> for efficient data handling, and <span className='text-custom-text-3'>Django</span> for powerful backend solutions. I also use <span className='text-custom-text-3'>Tailwind CSS</span> for streamlined UI development.

My software journey started during my internship, where I sharpened my problem-solving skills and gained hands-on experience in solution design. I excel in dynamic environments, collaborating across teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.

Beyond technical skills, I'm passionate about Blender, video editing and enjoy hobbies like cycling. I prioritize continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends. I'm committed to using technology to tackle real-world challenges and enhance user experiences. Whether optimizing code or pioneering new features, I approach each project with dedication and a commitment to excellence.

Outside of work, I engage actively in the developer community, attending tech meetups and exploring emerging frameworks. I value teamwork and effective communication in achieving project success, always eager to tackle new challenges in software development.
